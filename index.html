        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Wenyi!</h1>
				<p>I like making things since I was a kid, I wrote my first line of code in Logo Language when I got my first PC as a 9-year-old girl's birthday gift. Now I am working for human in software engineering. Besides of making(and breaking) things, I read delibrately. I started as a Chemical Engineer at Cal and have been exploring and reading on various technology topics ever since. I'd like to dedicate this area to gather my thoughts from daily reading/practice on business development, startups, software engineering and technologies. It will be fun! <a href="/about">Read More</a></p>
